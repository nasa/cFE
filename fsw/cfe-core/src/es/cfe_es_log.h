 * This is a temporary buffer that serves as a holding place for syslog data as
 * it is being dumped to a file on disk.  Since disks are comparatively slow and
 * access to the syslog buffer must be synchronized, copying to a temporary buffer
 * first significantly decreases the amount of time that the syslog is locked after
 * a file dump is requested.
 *
 * This buffer also reflects the Syslog "burst size" that is guaranteed to be
 * safe for concurrent writes and reads/dump operations.  If applications Log more than
 * this amount of data in less time than it takes to write this amount of data to disk,
 * then some log messages may be corrupt or lost in the output file.
 *
 * @note If contention occurs where applications would overwrite logs that are still
 * being "read" by a dump process, the realtime applications are given preference and
 * therefore NOT blocked.   Design preference is given to applications over the absolute
 * integrity of the dump file.
