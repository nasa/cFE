 * The #CFE_TIME_ClockState_Enum_t enumerations identify the three recognized states of the current time.
 * If the clock has never been successfully synchronized with the primary onboard clock source, the
 * time is conisdered to be #CFE_TIME_ClockState_INVALID.  If the time is currently synchronized (i.e. - the
 * primary synchronization mechanism has not been dropped for any significant amount of time), then
 * the current time is considered to be #CFE_TIME_ClockState_VALID.  If the time had, at some point in the past,
 * been synchronized, but the synchronization with the primary onboard clock has since been lost, then
 * the time is considered to be #CFE_TIME_ClockState_FLYWHEEL.  Since different clocks drift at different rates
 * from one another, the accuracy of the time while in #CFE_TIME_ClockState_FLYWHEEL is dependent upon the time
 * spent in that state.
