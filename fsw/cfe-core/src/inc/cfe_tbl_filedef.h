**
**  Title:   ELF2CFETBL Utility Header File for Table Images
**
**  Purpose:
**     This header file provides a data structure definition and macro definition
**     required in source code that is intended to be compiled into a cFE compatible
**     Table Image file.
**
**  Design Notes:
**
**     Typically, a user would include this file in a ".c" file that contains nothing
**     but a desired instantiation of values for a table image along with the macro
**     defined below.  After compilation, the resultant elf file can be processed using
**     the 'elf2cfetbl' utility to generate a file that can be loaded onto a cFE flight
**     system and successfully loaded into a table using the cFE Table Services.
**
**  References:
**     Flight Software Branch C Coding Standard Version 1.0a

**  Notes:
