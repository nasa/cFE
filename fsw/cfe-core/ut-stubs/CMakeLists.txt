# cFE stub function build recipe
#
# This CMake file contains the recipe for building the stub function
# libraries that correlate with the CFE public API.  This library supports
# unit testing of OTHER modules, where the test cases for those modules
# are linked with the stubs supplied here, rather than the normal CFE.

# how the real application is linked, in that cfe-core
