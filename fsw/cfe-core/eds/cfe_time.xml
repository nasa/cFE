            \par Description
                 The #CFE_TIME_ClockState_Enum_t enumerations identify the three recognized states of the current time.
                 If the clock has never been successfully synchronized with the primary onboard clock source, the
                 time is conisdered to be #CFE_TIME_ClockState_INVALID.  If the time is currently synchronized (i.e. - the
                 primary synchronization mechanism has not been dropped for any significant amount of time), then
                 the current time is considered to be #CFE_TIME_ClockState_VALID.  If the time had, at some point in the past,
                 been synchronized, but the synchronization with the primary onboard clock has since been lost, then
                 the time is considered to be #CFE_TIME_ClockState_FLYWHEEL.  Since different clocks drift at different rates
                 from one another, the accuracy of the time while in #CFE_TIME_ClockState_FLYWHEEL is dependent upon the time
                 spent in that state.

             values.  Time is referred to as the elapsed time (in seconds

             field contains the number of 2^(-32) second intervals that have

          This command selects the Time Service clock source.  Although the
          list of potential clock sources is mission specific and defined
          via configuration parameters, this command provides a common method
          for switching between the local processor clock and an external
          source for time data.
          
          When commanded to accept external time data (GPS, MET, spacecraft
          time, etc.), the Time Server will enable input via an API function
          specific to the configuration definitions for the particular source.
          When commanded to use internal time data, the Time Server will ignore
          the external data.  However, the Time Server will continue to use the
          API function as the trigger to generate a "time at the tone" command
          packet regardless of the internal/external command selection.
          
          Notes:
          - Operating in FLYWHEEL mode is not considered a choice related
          to clock source, but rather an element of the clock state.  See below
          for a description of the #CFE_TIME_SET_STATE_CC command.
          - This command is only valid when the #CFE_TIME_CFG_SOURCE configuration

          \cfetimecmd  Set Time State

          \par  Description
          This command indirectly affects the Time Service on-board determination
          of clock state.  Clock state is a combination of factors, most significantly
          whether the spacecraft time has been accurately set, and whether Time Service
          is operating in FLYWHEEL mode.
          
          This command may be used to notify the Time Server that spacecraft time is
          now correct, or that time is no longer correct.  This information will be
          distributed to Time Clients, and in turn, to any interested sub-systems.
          
          Also, this command may be used to force a Time Server or Time Client into
          FLYWHEEL mode.  Use of FLYWHEEL mode is mainly for debug purposes although
          in extreme circumstances, it may be of value to force Time Service not to rely
          on normal time updates.  Note that when commanded into FLYWHEEL mode, the Time
          Service will remain so until receipt of another "set state" command setting the
          state into a mode other than FLYWHEEL.
          
          Note also that setting the clock state to VALID or INVALID on a Time Client that
          is currently getting time updates from the Time Server will have very limited
          effect.  As soon as the Time Client receives the next time update, the VALID/INVALID
          selection will be set to that of the Time Server.  However, setting a Time Client
          to FLYWHEEL cannot be overridden by the Time Server since the Time Client will
          ignore time updates from the Time Server while in FLYWHEEL mode.

          - Error specific event message (#CFE_TIME_STATE_ERR_EID)

          \par  Criticality
          Setting Time Service into FLYWHEEL mode is not particularly hazardous, as
          the result may be that the calculation of spacecraft time is done using a
          less than optimal timer.  However, inappropriately setting the clock state
          to VALID (indicating that spacecraft time is accurate) may result in other
          sub-systems performing incorrect time based calculations.  The specific risk
          is dependent upon the behavior of those sub-systems.

          This command sets the Mission Elapsed Timer (MET) to the specified value.
          
          Note that the MET (as implemented for cFE Time Service) is a logical representation
          and not a physical timer.  Thus, setting the MET is not dependent on whether the
          hardware supports a MET register that can be written to.
          
          Note also that Time Service "assumes" that during normal operation, the MET is
          synchronized to the tone signal.  Therefore, unless operating in FLYWHEEL mode,
          the sub-seconds portion of the MET will be set to zero at the next tone signal interrupt.
          
          The new MET takes effect immediately upon execution of this command.
