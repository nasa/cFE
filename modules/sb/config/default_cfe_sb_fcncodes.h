/** \cfesbcmd Software Bus No-Op
**
**  \par Description
**       This command performs no other function than to increment the
**       command execution counter. The command may be used to verify
**       general aliveness of the Software Bus task.
**
**  \cfecmdmnemonic \SB_NOOP
**

**       #CFE_SB_NoopCmd_t
**
**  \par Command Verification
**       Successful execution of this command may be verified with the
**       following telemetry:
**       - \b \c \SB_CMDPC - command execution counter will
**         increment
**       - The #CFE_SB_NOOP_INF_EID informational event message will
**         be generated
**
**  \par Error Conditions
**       There are no error conditions for this command. If the Software
**       Bus receives the command, the event is sent (although it
**       may be filtered by EVS) and the counter is incremented
**       unconditionally.

**       This command is not inherently dangerous.  However, it is
**       possible for ground systems and on-board safing procedures
**       to be designed such that they react to changes in the counter
**       values that are reset by this command.

**
**  \par Criticality
**       This command is not inherently dangerous.  It will create and send

**
**  \par Error Conditions
**       This command may fail for the following reason(s):
**       - A previous request to write a software bus information file has not yet completed
**       - The specified FileName cannot be parsed
**
**       Evidence of failure may be found in the following telemetry:
**       - \b \c \SB_CMDEC - command error counter will increment

**         cases. See #CFE_SB_SND_RTG_ERR1_EID and #CFE_SB_FILEWRITE_ERR_EID
**
**  \par Criticality
**       This command is not inherently dangerous.  It will create a new
**       file in the file system and could, if performed repeatedly without
**       sufficient file management by the operator, fill the file system.

**  \par Criticality
**       This command is not intended to be used in nominal conditions. It is
**       possible to get into a state where a destination cannot be re-enabled
**       without resetting the processor. For instance, sending this command
