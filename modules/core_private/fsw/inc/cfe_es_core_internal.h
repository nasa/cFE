** \brief Reserve space (or re-obtain previously reserved space) in the Critical Data Store (CDS)
**
** \par Description
**        This routine is identical to #CFE_ES_RegisterCDS except it identifies the contents
**        of the CDS as a critical table.  This is crucial because a critical table CDS must
**        only be deleted by cFE Table Services, not via an ES delete CDS command.  Otherwise,
**        Table Services may be out of sync with the contents of the CDS.
**
** \par Assumptions, External Events, and Notes:
**        -# This function assumes input parameters are error free and have met size/value restrictions.
**        -# The calling function is responsible for issuing any event messages associated with errors.

** \brief Deletes the specified CDS from the CDS Registry and frees CDS Memory
**
** \par Description
**        Removes the record of the specified CDS from the CDS Registry and

**
**        This operation invalidates the registry entry and returns
**        the underlying data storage back to the CDS pool for re-use.
**
** \par Assumptions, External Events, and Notes:
**        The actual data block is not modified by this call.  Specifically, this does not
**        "wipe" or otherwise overwrite the data block.  If the application needs to ensure
