**       - \b \c \ES_CMDPC - command execution counter will
**         increment

/** \cfeescmd Executive Services Processor / Power-On Reset
**
**  \par Description
**       This command restarts the cFE in one of two modes.  The Power-On Reset
**       will cause the cFE to restart as though the power were first applied
**       to the processor.  The Processor Reset will attempt to retain the contents
**       of the volatile disk and the contents of the Critical Data Store.
**       NOTE: If a requested Processor Reset should cause the
**       Processor Reset Counter (\b \c \ES_PROCRESETCNT)
**       to exceed OR EQUAL the limit #CFE_PLATFORM_ES_MAX_PROCESSOR_RESETS (which is reported in
**       housekeeping telemetry as \b \c \ES_MAXPROCRESETS),
**       the command is \b AUTOMATICALLY upgraded to a Power-On Reset.

**  \par Command Structure
**       #CFE_ES_RestartCmd_t
**
**  \par Command Verification
**       Successful execution of this command (as a Processor Reset)
**       may be verified with the following telemetry:
**       - \b \c \ES_PROCRESETCNT - processor reset counter will increment
**       - New entries in the Exception Reset Log and System Log can be found<BR>
**       NOTE: Verification of a Power-On Reset is shown through the loss of
**       data nominally retained through a Processor Reset<BR>
**       NOTE: Since the reset of the processor resets the command execution
**       counter (\b \c \ES_CMDPC), this counter \b CANNOT be used to verify
**       command execution.
**
**  \par Error Conditions
**       This command may fail for the following reason(s):
**       - The command packet length is incorrect
**       - The \link #CFE_ES_RestartCmd_Payload_t Restart Type \endlink was
**         not a recognized value.
**
**       Evidence of failure may be found in the following telemetry:
**       - \b \c \ES_CMDEC - command error counter will increment
**       - the #CFE_ES_BOOT_ERR_EID error event message will be generated
**
**  \par Criticality
**       This command is, by definition, dangerous.  Significant loss of
**       data will occur.  All processes and the cFE itself will be stopped
**       and restarted.  With the Power-On reset option, all data on the
**       volatile disk and the contents of the Critical Data Store will be
**       lost.
