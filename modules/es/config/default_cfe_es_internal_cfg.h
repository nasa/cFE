**      ES Application Kill Timeout. This parameter controls the number of

**      the signal Delete, Reload or Restart. The sequence works as follows:
**      -# ES will set the control request for an App to Delete/Restart/Reload and
**         set this kill timer to the value in this parameter.
**      -# If the App is responding and Calls it's RunLoop function, it will drop out
**         of it's main loop and call CFE_ES_ExitApp. Once it calls Exit App, then
**         ES can delete, restart, or reload the app the next time it scans the app
**         table.
**      -# If the App is not responding, the ES App will decrement this Kill Timeout
**         value each time it runs. If the timeout value reaches zero, ES will kill
**         the app.
**
**      The Kill timeout value depends on the #CFE_PLATFORM_ES_APP_SCAN_RATE. If the Scan Rate
**      is 1000, or 1 second, and this #CFE_PLATFORM_ES_APP_KILL_TIMEOUT is set to 5, then it
**      will take 5 seconds to kill a non-responding App.
**      If the Scan Rate is 250, or 1/4 second, and the #CFE_PLATFORM_ES_APP_KILL_TIMEOUT is
**      set to 2, then it will take 1/2 second to time out.
**
**  \par Limits
**       There is a lower limit of 1 and an upper limit of 100 on this configuration
**       parameter. Units are number of #CFE_PLATFORM_ES_APP_SCAN_RATE cycles.

**      Volatile ( RAM ) Disk has a defined amount of free space during a processor
**      reset. The cFE uses the Volatile disk to decompress cFE applications during
**      system startup. If this Volatile disk happens to get filled with logs and
**      misc files, then a processor reset may not work, because there will be no
**      room to decompress cFE apps. To solve that problem, this parameter sets the
**      "Low Water Mark" for disk space on a Processor reset. It should be set to
**      allow the largest cFE Application to be decompressed.
**      During a Processor reset, if there is not sufficient space left on the disk,
**      it will be re-formatted in order to clear up some space.

/** \cfeescfg Poll timer for startup sync delay
**
**  \par Description:
**      During startup, some tasks may need to synchronize their own initialization
**      with the initialization of other applications in the system.
**
**      CFE ES implements an API to accomplish this, that performs a task delay (sleep)
**      while polling the overall system state until other tasks are ready.
**
**      This value controls the amount of time that the CFE_ES_ApplicationSyncDelay
**      will sleep between each check of the system state.  This should be large enough
**      to allow other tasks to run, but not so large as to noticeably delay the startup
**      completion.
**
**      Units are in milliseconds

**  \par Limits:
**       Must be defined as an integer value that is greater than
**       or equal to zero.
