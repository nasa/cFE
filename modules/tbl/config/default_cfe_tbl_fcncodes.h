/** \cfetblcmd Table No-Op
**
**  \par Description
**       This command performs no other function than to increment the
**       command execution counter. The command may be used to verify
**       general aliveness of the Table Services task.
**
**  \cfecmdmnemonic \TBL_NOOP
**
**  \par Command Structure
**       #CFE_TBL_NoopCmd_t
**
**  \par Command Verification
**       Successful execution of this command may be verified with the
**       following telemetry:
**       - \b \c \TBL_CMDPC - command execution counter will
**         increment
**       - The #CFE_TBL_NOOP_INF_EID informational event message will
**         be generated
**
**  \par Error Conditions
**       There are no error conditions for this command. If the Table
**       Services receives the command, the event is sent (although it
**       may be filtered by EVS) and the counter is incremented
**       unconditionally.

/** \cfetblcmd Table Reset Counters
**
**  \par Description
**       This command resets the following counters within the Table
**       Services housekeeping telemetry:
**       - Command Execution Counter (\TBL_CMDPC)
**       - Command Error Counter (\TBL_CMDEC)
**       - Successful Table Validations Counter (\TBL_VALSUCCESSCTR)
**       - Failed Table Validations Counter (\TBL_VALFAILEDCTR)

**       - Number of completed table validations (\TBL_VALCOMPLTDCTR)
**
**  \cfecmdmnemonic \TBL_RESETCTRS
**
**  \par Command Structure
**       #CFE_TBL_ResetCountersCmd_t
**
**  \par Command Verification
**       Successful execution of this command may be verified with
**       the following telemetry:
**       - \b \c \TBL_CMDPC - command execution counter will
**         be reset to 0
**       - The #CFE_TBL_RESET_INF_EID informational event message will be
**         generated
**
**  \par Error Conditions
**       There are no error conditions for this command. If the Table
**       Services receives the command, the event is sent (although it
**       may be filtered by EVS) and the counter is incremented
**       unconditionally.
**
**  \par Criticality
**       This command is not inherently dangerous.  However, it is
**       possible for ground systems and on-board safing procedures
**       to be designed such that they react to changes in the counter
**       values that are reset by this command.

/** \cfetblcmd Load Table
**
**  \par Description
**       This command loads the contents of the specified file into
**       an inactive buffer for the table specified within the file.
**
**  \cfecmdmnemonic \TBL_LOAD
**
**  \par Command Structure
**       #CFE_TBL_LoadCmd_t
**
**  \par Command Verification
**       Successful execution of this command may be verified with
**       the following telemetry:
**       - \b \c \TBL_CMDPC - command execution counter will
**         increment
**       - The #CFE_TBL_FILE_LOADED_INF_EID informational event message
**         will be generated
**
**  \par Error Conditions
**       This command can fail for the following reasons:
**       - Table name found in table image file's table header is not found
**         in table registry (ie - The table associated with the table image
**         in the file has not been registered by an application).
**       - The table image file has an invalid or incorrect size.  The size of
**         the image file must match the size field within in the header, and
**         must also match the expected size of the table indicated in the registry.
**       - No working buffers are available for the load.  This would indicate
**         that too many single-buffered table loads are in progress at the same
**         time.
**       - An attempt is being made to load an uninitialized table with a file
**         containing only a partial table image.
**       - The table image file was unable to be opened.  Either the file does
**         not exist at the specified location, the filename is in error, or
**         the file system has been corrupted.
**
**       Evidence of failure may be found in the following telemetry:
**       - \b \c \TBL_CMDEC - command error counter will increment
**       - Command specific error event messages are issued for all error cases
**
**  \par Criticality
**       This command is not inherently dangerous.  It is performing the first
**       step of loading a table and can be aborted (using the Abort Table Load
**       command described below) without affecting the contents of the active
**       table image.

/** \cfetblcmd Dump Table
**
**  \par Description
**       This command will cause the Table Services to put the contents
**       of the specified table buffer into the command specified file.
**
**  \cfecmdmnemonic \TBL_DUMP
**
**  \par Command Structure
**       #CFE_TBL_DumpCmd_t

**       - Either the #CFE_TBL_OVERWRITE_DUMP_INF_EID OR the
**         #CFE_TBL_WRITE_DUMP_INF_EID informational event message will
**         be generated
**
**  \par Error Conditions
**       This command may fail for the following reason(s):
**       - A single buffered table's inactive buffer was requested to be
**         dumped and no such buffer is currently allocated.
**       - Error occurred during write operation to file. Possible causes
**         might be insufficient space in the file system or the filename
**         or file path is improperly specified.
**       - The specified table name was not found in the table registry.
**
**       Evidence of failure may be found in the following telemetry:
**       - \b \c \TBL_CMDEC - command error counter will increment
**       - A command specific error event message is issued for all error
**         cases
**
**  \par Criticality
**       This command is not inherently dangerous.  It will create a new
**       file in the file system and could, if performed repeatedly without
**       sufficient file management by the operator, fill the file system.

/** \cfetblcmd Validate Table
**
**  \par Description
**       This command will cause Table Services to calculate the Data Integrity
**       Value for the specified table and to notify the owning application that

**  \par Command Structure
**       #CFE_TBL_ValidateCmd_t

**  \par Command Verification
**       Successful execution of this command may be verified with the following
**       telemetry:
**       - \b \c \TBL_CMDPC -  command execution counter will increment
**       - \b \c \TBL_VALREQCTR - table validation request counter will increment
**       - \b \c \TBL_LASTVALCRC - calculated data integrity value will be updated

**       - Either \b \c \TBL_VALSUCCESSCTR OR \b \c \TBL_VALFAILEDCTR will
**         increment
**       - \b \c \TBL_VALCOMPLTDCTR - table validations performed counter will
**         increment
**       - \b \c \TBL_LASTVALS - table validation function return status will
**         update
**       - The #CFE_TBL_VALIDATION_INF_EID informational event message (indicating the
**         validation function return status) will be generated
**
**  \par Error Conditions
**       This command may fail for the following reason(s):
**       - A single buffered table's inactive buffer was requested to be validated
**         and no such buffer is currently allocated.
**       - Too many validations have been requested simultaneously.  The operator
**         must wait for one or more applications to perform their table validation
**         functions before trying again.
**       - The specified table name was not found in the table registry.
**
**       Evidence of failure may be found in the following telemetry:
**       - \b \c \TBL_CMDEC - command error counter will increment
**       - Command specific error event message are issued for all error cases
**
**  \par Criticality
**       The success or failure of a table validation does not have any immediate
**       impact on table contents.  The results are sent to the operator in telemetry
**       and the operator must determine whether the results are acceptable and send a
**       command to activate the validated table image.

/** \cfetblcmd Activate Table
