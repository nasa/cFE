/**
**  \cfemissioncfg cFE Maximum length for pathnames within data exchange structures
**
**  \par Description:
**       The value of this constant dictates the size of pathnames within all structures
**       used for external data exchange, such as Software bus messages and table definitions.
**       This is typically the same as OS_MAX_PATH_LEN but that is OSAL dependent --
**       and as such it definable on a per-processor/OS basis and hence may be different
**       across multiple processors.  It is recommended to set this to the value of the
**       largest OS_MAX_PATH_LEN in use on any CPU on the mission.
**
**       This affects only the layout of command/telemetry messages and table definitions;
**       internal allocation may use the platform-specific OS_MAX_PATH_LEN value.
**
**       This length must include an extra character for NULL termination.
**
**  \par Limits
**       All CPUs within the same SB domain (mission) and ground tools must share the
**       same definition.
**       Note this affects the size of messages, so it must not cause any message
**       to exceed the max length.
**
**       This value should be kept as a multiple of 4, to maintain alignment of
**       any possible neighboring fields without implicit padding.
