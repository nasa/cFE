/**

 *
 * Contains global prototypes and definitions related to resource

 *
 * A CFE ES Resource ID is a common way to identify CFE-managed resources such
 * as apps, tasks, counters, memory pools, CDS blocks, and other entities.
 *
 * Simple operations are provided as inline functions, which
 * should alleviate the need to do direct manipulation of resource IDs:
 *
 *  - Check for undefined ID value
 *  - Check for equality of two ID values
 *  - Convert ID to simple integer (typically for printing/logging)
 *  - Convert simple integer to ID (inverse of above)
