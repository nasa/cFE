**  \brief Enumerated types identifying the relative relationships of two times
**
**  \par Description
**       Since time fields contain numbers that are relative to an epoch time, then it is possible for a time value
**       to be "negative".  This can lead to some confusion about what relationship exists between two time values.
**       To resolve this confusion, the cFE provides the API #CFE_TIME_Compare which returns these enumerated values.
