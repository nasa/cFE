**        data acquired from an external source.  There is a presumption that
**        this function will be called at the appropriate time (relative to the
**        tone) such that this call may be used by cFE TIME as the signal to
**        generate the "time at the tone" data command.  The "time at the tone"
**        data command must arrive within the configuration specified window for
**        tone signal and data packet verification. <br> <br>
**        Internally, cFE TIME will calculate a new STCF as the difference between
**        this new time value and the spacecraft MET value at the tone.  This allows
**        cFE TIME to always calculate time as the sum of MET and STCF.  The value
**        of STCF will change only as much as the drift factor between spacecraft
**        MET and the external time source.
**
** \par Assumptions, External Events, and Notes:
**          - This routine is included in the API only when 3 specific configuration
**            parameters are set to true.  The first is #CFE_PLATFORM_TIME_CFG_SERVER which defines this
**            instantiation of cFE TIME as a time server (not a client).  The second
**            required configuration parameter is #CFE_PLATFORM_TIME_CFG_SOURCE which enables
**            time source selection commands to the cFE TIME task, and further enables
**            configuration definitions for the selected type of external time data.
**            The third configuration parameter required for this routine is
**            #CFE_PLATFORM_TIME_CFG_SRC_TIME, which indicates that the external time data consists
**            of a time value relative to a known epoch.
**
** \param[in]  NewTime   The MET value at the next (or previous) 1 Hz tone signal.
