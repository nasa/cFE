/**
**  \cfetimecfg Default Time Format
**
**  \par Description:
**      The following definitions select either UTC or TAI as the default
**      (mission specific) time format.  Although it is possible for an
**      application to request time in a specific format, most callers
**      should use CFE_TIME_GetTime(), which returns time in the default
**      format.  This avoids having to modify each individual caller
**      when the default choice is changed.
**
**  \par Limits
**      if CFE_MISSION_TIME_CFG_DEFAULT_TAI is defined as true then CFE_MISSION_TIME_CFG_DEFAULT_UTC must be
**      defined as false.
**      if CFE_MISSION_TIME_CFG_DEFAULT_TAI is defined as false then CFE_MISSION_TIME_CFG_DEFAULT_UTC must be
**      defined as true.

/**
**  \cfetimecfg Default Time and Tone Order
**
**  \par Description:
**      Time Services may be configured to expect the time at the tone
**      data packet to either precede or follow the tone signal.  If the
**      time at the tone data packet follows the tone signal, then the
**      data within the packet describes what the time "was" at the tone.
**      If the time at the tone data packet precedes the tone signal, then
**      the data within the packet describes what the time "will be" at
**      the tone.  One, and only one, of the following symbols must be set to true:
**      - CFE_MISSION_TIME_AT_TONE_WAS
**      - CFE_MISSION_TIME_AT_TONE_WILL_BE
**      Note: If Time Services is defined as using a simulated tone signal
**            (see #CFE_MISSION_TIME_CFG_FAKE_TONE above), then the tone data packet
**            must follow the tone signal.
**
**  \par Limits
**      Either CFE_MISSION_TIME_AT_TONE_WAS or CFE_MISSION_TIME_AT_TONE_WILL_BE must be set to true.
**      They may not both be true and they may not both be false.

/**
**  \cfetimecfg Min and Max Time Elapsed
**
**  \par Description:
**      Based on the definition of Time and Tone Order
**      (CFE_MISSION_TIME_AT_TONE_WAS/WILL_BE) either the "time at the tone" signal or
**      data packet will follow the other. This definition sets the valid window
**      of time for the second of the pair to lag behind the first. Time
**      Services will invalidate both the tone and packet if the second does not
**      arrive within this window following the first.
**
**      For example, if the data packet follows the tone, it might be valid for
**      the data packet to arrive between zero and 100,000 micro-seconds after
**      the tone.  But, if the tone follows the packet, it might be valid
**      only if the packet arrived between 200,000 and 700,000 micro-seconds
**      before the tone.

**      Note: units are in micro-seconds

/**
**  \cfetimecfg Default Time Values
**
**  \par Description:
**      Default time values are provided to avoid problems due to time
**      calculations performed after startup but before commands can be
**      processed.  For example, if the default time format is UTC then
**      it is important that the sum of MET and STCF always exceed the
**      value of Leap Seconds to prevent the UTC time calculation
**     <tt>(time = MET + STCF - Leap Seconds) </tt> from resulting in a negative
**     (very large) number.<BR><BR>
**     Some past missions have also created known (albeit wrong) default
**     timestamps.  For example, assume the epoch is defined as Jan 1, 1970
**     and further assume the default time values are set to create a timestamp
**     of Jan 1, 2000.  Even though the year 2000 timestamps are wrong, it
**     may be of value to keep the time within some sort of bounds acceptable
**     to the software.<BR><BR>
**     Note: Sub-second units are in micro-seconds (0 to 999,999) and
**           all values must be defined
