/** \cfetimecmd Set Time Source
**
**  \par Description
**       This command selects the Time Service clock source.  Although the
**       list of potential clock sources is mission-specific and defined
**       via configuration parameters, this command provides a common method
**       for switching between the local processor clock and an external
**       source for time data.<BR><BR>
**       When commanded to accept external time data (GPS, MET, spacecraft
**       time, etc.), the Time Server will enable input via an API function
**       specific to the configuration definitions for the particular source.
**       When commanded to use internal time data, the Time Server will ignore
**       the external data.  However, the Time Server will continue to use the
**       API function as the trigger to generate a "time at the tone" command
**       packet regardless of the internal/external command selection.<BR><BR>
**       Notes:
**       - Operating in FLYWHEEL mode is not considered a choice related
**         to clock source, but rather an element of the clock state.  See below
**         for a description of the #CFE_TIME_SET_STATE_CC command.
**       - This command is only valid when the #CFE_PLATFORM_TIME_CFG_SOURCE configuration
**         parameter in the cfe_platform_cfg.h file has been set to true.

/** \cfetimecmd Set Time State
**
**  \par Description
**       This command indirectly affects the Time Service on-board determination
**       of clock state.  Clock state is a combination of factors, most significantly
**       whether the spacecraft time has been accurately set, and whether Time Service
**       is operating in FLYWHEEL mode.<BR><BR>
**       This command may be used to notify the Time Server that spacecraft time is
**       now correct, or that time is no longer correct.  This information will be
**       distributed to Time Clients, and in turn, to any interested sub-systems.<BR><BR>
**       Also, this command may be used to force a Time Server or Time Client into
**       FLYWHEEL mode.  Use of FLYWHEEL mode is mainly for debug purposes although
**       in extreme circumstances, it may be of value to force Time Service not to rely
**       on normal time updates.  Note that when commanded into FLYWHEEL mode, the Time
**       Service will remain so until receipt of another "set state" command setting the
**       state into a mode other than FLYWHEEL.<BR><BR>
**       Note also that setting the clock state to VALID or INVALID on a Time Client that
**       is currently getting time updates from the Time Server will have very limited
**       effect.  As soon as the Time Client receives the next time update, the VALID/INVALID
**       selection will be set to that of the Time Server.  However, setting a Time Client
**       to FLYWHEEL cannot be overridden by the Time Server since the Time Client will
**       ignore time updates from the Time Server while in FLYWHEEL mode.

**
**  \par Criticality
**       Setting Time Service into FLYWHEEL mode is not particularly hazardous, as
**       the result may be that the calculation of spacecraft time is done using a
**       less than optimal timer.  However, inappropriately setting the clock state
**       to VALID (indicating that spacecraft time is accurate) may result in other
**       sub-systems performing incorrect time based calculations.  The specific risk
**       is dependent upon the behavior of those sub-systems.

**       after the determination was made that one micro-second is too large an

**       This command continuously adjusts the Spacecraft Time Correlation Factor (STCF)
**       every second, by adding the specified value.  The adjustment to the STCF is
**       applied in the Time Service local 1Hz interrupt handler.  As the local 1Hz
**       interrupt is not synchronized to the tone signal, one cannot say when the
**       adjustment will occur, other than once a second, at about the same time
**       relative to the tone.<BR><BR>
**       There was some debate about whether the maximum 1Hz clock drift correction
**       factor would ever need to exceed some small fraction of a second.  But, the
**       decision was made to provide the capability to make 1Hz adjustments greater
**       than one second and leave it to the ground system to provide mission-specific
