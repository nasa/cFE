/** 
** \brief Register an application for receiving event services
**
** \par Description
**          This routine registers an application with event services and allocates/initializes
**          the internal data structures used to support this application's events.  An application
**          may not send events unless it has called this routine.  The routine also accepts a filter
**          array structure for applications requiring event filtering.  In the current implementation
**          of the EVS, only the binary filtering scheme is supported.  See section TBD of the cFE
**          Application Programmer's Guide for a description of the behavior of binary filters.
**          Applications may call #CFE_EVS_Register more than once, but each call will wipe out all
**          filters registered by previous calls (filter registration is NOT cumulative).
**
** \par Assumptions, External Events, and Notes:
**          Note: Event filters can be added, deleted or modified by ground commands.  All filtering 
**                schemes include a default setting that results in no filtering (such as #CFE_EVS_NO_FILTER 
**                for binary filters).
**

**
** \param[in] Filters            Pointer to an array of event message filters, or NULL if no filtering is desired.  
**                               The structure of an event message filter depends on the FilterScheme selected. 
**                               (see Filter Schemes mentioned above) 
**
** \param[in] NumFilteredEvents  The number of event message filters included in this call.  This must be less than
**                               or equal to the maximum number of events allowed per application (#CFE_EVS_MAX_EVENT_FILTERS).
**
** \param[in] FilterScheme       The event filtering scheme that this application will use.  For the first implementation of 
**                               the event services, only filter type #CFE_EVS_BINARY_FILTER will be supported.
