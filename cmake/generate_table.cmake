# Sub-script to generate a table file via elf2cfetbl
#
# This small script runs at build time (as opposed to prep time)
# which converts a static library (.a) with a single object into a
# table (.tbl) file

# Required passed in values:
#  CMAKE_AR => path to "ar" utility for working with static lib files
#  TBLTOOL => path to "elf2cfetbl" utility or equivalent utility
#  LIB => name of library file to convert
#
# This assumes/requires that the static library has a single object in it.
# Note, In newer versions of CMake an object library can be used. This workaround
# is intended to also be compatible with older CMake versions.
#

# First run "ar t" to get the object file name, there should be only 1 file.
