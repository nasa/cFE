# Core Flight Software CMake / GNU make wrapper
#
# ABOUT THIS MAKEFILE:
# This is actually part of the CMake alternative build system.
# It is a GNU-make wrapper that calls the CMake tools appropriately
# so that setting up a new build is fast and easy with no need to
# learn the CMake commands.  It also makes it easier to integrate
# the build with IDE tools such as Eclipse by providing a default
# makefile that has the common targets such as all/clean/etc.
#
# Use of this file is optional.
#
# This file is intended to be placed at the TOP-MOST level of the mission
# source tree, i.e. a level above "cfe".  Note this is outside the cfe
# repository which is why it cannot be delivered directly in place.
# To use it, simply copy it to the top directory.  As this just contains
# wrappers for the CMake targets, it is unlikely to change.  Projects
# are also free to customize this file and add their own targets after 
# copying it to the top of the source tree.
#
# For _ALL_ targets defined in this file the build tree location may 
# be specified via the "O" variable (i.e. make O=<my-build-dir> all).  
# If not specified then the "build" subdirectory will be assumed. 
#
# This wrapper defines the following major targets:
#  prep -- Runs CMake to create a new or re-configure an existing build tree
#    Note that multiple build trees can exist from a single source
#    Other control options (such as "SIMULATION") may be passed to CMake via 
#    make variables depending on the mission build scripts.  These will be
#    cached in the build tree so they do not need to be set again thereafter. 
#
#  all -- Build all targets in the CMake build tree
#          
#  install -- Copy all files to the installation tree and run packaging scripts
#     The "DESTDIR" environment variable controls where the files are copied        
#
#  clean -- Clean all targets in the CMake build tree, but not the build tree itself.
#
#  distclean -- Entirely remove the build directory specified by "O" 
#      Note that after this the "prep" step must be run again in order to build.
#      Use caution with this as it does an rm -rf - don't set O to your home dir!
#
#  doc -- Build all doxygen source documentation.  The HTML documentation will be
#      generated under the build tree specified by "O". 
#
#  test -- Run all unit tests defined in the build.  Unit tests will typically only
#      be executable when building with the "SIMULATION=native" option.  Otherwise
#      it is up to the user to copy the executables to the target and run them.
#  
#  lcov -- Runs the "lcov" tool on the build tree to collect all code coverage
#      analysis data and build the reports.  Code coverage data may be output by
#      the "make test" target above.
#

# Establish default values for critical variables.  Any of these may be overridden
# on the command line or via the make environment configuration in an IDE
O ?= build
ARCH ?= native
BUILDTYPE ?= debug
INSTALLPREFIX ?= /exe
DESTDIR ?= $(O)

# The "DESTDIR" variable is a bit more complicated because it should be an absolute
# path for CMake, but we want to accept either absolute or relative paths.  So if
# the path does NOT start with "/", prepend it with the current directory.

# Any other target may also be given, in that case it will simply be passed through.

DIRTGTS := $(filter %/,$(OTHERTGTS))

# as there might be a target by that name.  For example, this is useful for rebuilding 
# single unit test executable files while debugging from the IDE
