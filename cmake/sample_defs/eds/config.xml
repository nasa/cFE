            This definition is used as the array size with the pool stats structure,
            and therefore should be consistent across all CPUs in a mission, as well
            as with the ground station.

            There is also a platform-specific limit which may be fewer than this
            value.

        \cfemissioncfg cFE Maximum length for pathnames within data exchange structures

        \par Description:
            The value of this constant dictates the size of pathnames within all structures
            used for external data exchange, such as Software bus messages and table definitions.
            This is typically the same as OS_MAX_PATH_LEN but that is OSAL dependent --
            and as such it definable on a per-processor/OS basis and hence may be different
            across multiple processors.  It is recommended to set this to the value of the
            largest OS_MAX_PATH_LEN in use on any CPU on the mission.

            This affects only the layout of command/telemetry messages and table definitions;
            internal allocation may use the platform-specific OS_MAX_PATH_LEN value.

            This length must include an extra character for NULL termination.

      \cfesbcfg Maximum SB Message Size

      \par Description:
          The following definition dictates the maximum message size allowed on
          the software bus. SB checks the pkt length field in the header of all
          messages sent. If the pkt length field indicates the message is larger
          than this define, SB sends an event and rejects the send.

      \par Limits
          This parameter has a lower limit of 6 (CCSDS primary header size).  There
          are no restrictions on the upper limit however, the maximum message size is
          system dependent and should be verified.  Total message size values that are

          (mission specific) time format.  Although it is possible for an
          application to request time in a specific format, most callers
          should use CFE_TIME_GetTime(), which returns time in the default
          format.  This avoids having to modify each individual caller
          when the default choice is changed.

      \par Limits
          if CFE_MISSION_TIME_CFG_DEFAULT_TAI is defined as true then CFE_MISSION_TIME_CFG_DEFAULT_UTC must be
          defined as false.
          if CFE_MISSION_TIME_CFG_DEFAULT_TAI is defined as false then CFE_MISSION_TIME_CFG_DEFAULT_UTC must be

      \cfetimecfg Default Time and Tone Order

      \par Description:
          Time Services may be configured to expect the time at the tone
          data packet to either precede or follow the tone signal.  If the
          time at the tone data packet follows the tone signal, then the
          data within the packet describes what the time "was" at the tone.
          If the time at the tone data packet precedes the tone signal, then
          the data within the packet describes what the time "will be" at
          the tone.  One, and only one, of the following symbols must be set to true:

          - CFE_MISSION_TIME_AT_TONE_WAS
          - CFE_MISSION_TIME_AT_TONE_WILL_BE

          Note: If Time Services is defined as using a simulated tone signal
                (see #CFE_MISSION_TIME_CFG_FAKE_TONE above), then the tone data packet
                must follow the tone signal.

      \par Limits
          Either CFE_MISSION_TIME_AT_TONE_WAS or CFE_MISSION_TIME_AT_TONE_WILL_BE must be set to true.
          They may not both be true and they may not both be false.

      \par Description:
          Based on the definition of Time and Tone Order
          (CFE_MISSION_TIME_AT_TONE_WAS/WILL_BE) either the "time at the tone" signal or
          data packet will follow the other. This definition sets the valid window
          of time for the second of the pair to lag behind the first. Time
          Services will invalidate both the tone and packet if the second does not
          arrive within this window following the first.

          For example, if the data packet follows the tone, it might be valid for
          the data packet to arrive between zero and 100,000 micro-seconds after
          the tone.  But, if the tone follows the packet, it might be valid
          only if the packet arrived between 200,000 and 700,000 micro-seconds
          before the tone.

    <Define name="TIME_DEF_MET_SECS" value="1000">
      <LongDescription>
      \cfetimecfg Default Time Values

      \par Description:
          Default time values are provided to avoid problems due to time
          calculations performed after startup but before commands can be
          processed.  For example, if the default time format is UTC then
          it is important that the sum of MET and STCF always exceed the
          value of Leap Seconds to prevent the UTC time calculation

          (time = MET + STCF - Leap Seconds) from resulting in a negative
          (very large) number.

          Some past missions have also created known (albeit wrong) default
          timestamps.  For example, assume the epoch is defined as Jan 1, 1970
          and further assume the default time values are set to create a timestamp
          of Jan 1, 2000.  Even though the year 2000 timestamps are wrong, it
          may be of value to keep the time within some sort of bounds acceptable
          to the software.

          Note: Sub-second units are in micro-seconds (0 to 999,999) and

        \cfemissioncfg cFE Maximum length for API names within data exchange structures

        \par Description:
            The value of this constant dictates the size of filenames within all structures
            used for external data exchange, such as Software bus messages and table definitions.
            This is typically the same as OS_MAX_API_LEN but that is OSAL dependent --
            and as such it definable on a per-processor/OS basis and hence may be different
            across multiple processors.  It is recommended to set this to the value of the
            largest OS_MAX_API_LEN in use on any CPU on the mission.

            This affects only the layout of command/telemetry messages and table definitions;
            internal allocation may use the platform-specific OS_MAX_API_LEN value.

            This length must include an extra character for NULL termination.

        \par Limits
            All CPUs within the same SB domain (mission) must share the same definition
            Note this affects the size of messages, so it must not cause any message
            to exceed the max length.

            This value should be kept as a multiple of 4, to maintain alignment of
            any possible neighboring fields without implicit padding.

        \cfeescfg Maximum Length of Full CDS Name in messages

        \par Description:
            Indicates the maximum length (in characters) of the entire CDS name
            of the following form: "ApplicationName.CDSName"

            This affects the layout of command/telemetry messages but does not affect run
            time behavior or internal allocation.

            All CPUs within the same SB domain (mission) must share the same definition
            Note this affects the size of messages, so it must not cause any message
            to exceed the max length.
