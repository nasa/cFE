/**
**  \cfeescfg Define ES Application Kill Timeout
**
**  \par Description:
**      ES Application Kill Timeout. This parameter controls the number of
**      "scan periods" that ES will wait for an application to Exit after getting
**      the signal Delete, Reload or Restart. The sequence works as follows:
**      -# ES will set the control request for an App to Delete/Restart/Reload and
**         set this kill timer to the value in this parameter.
**      -# If the App is reponding and Calls it's RunLoop function, it will drop out
**         of it's main loop and call CFE_ES_ExitApp. Once it calls Exit App, then
**         ES can delete, restart, or reload the app the next time it scans the app
**         table.
**      -# If the App is not responding, the ES App will decrement this Kill Timeout
**         value each time it runs. If the timeout value reaches zero, ES will kill
**         the app.
**
**      The Kill timeout value depends on the #CFE_PLATFORM_ES_APP_SCAN_RATE. If the Scan Rate
**      is 1000, or 1 second, and this #CFE_PLATFORM_ES_APP_KILL_TIMEOUT is set to 5, then it
**      will take 5 seconds to kill a non-responding App.
**      If the Scan Rate is 250, or 1/4 second, and the #CFE_PLATFORM_ES_APP_KILL_TIMEOUT is
**      set to 2, then it will take 1/2 second to time out.
**
**  \par Limits

**       paramater. Units are number of #CFE_PLATFORM_ES_APP_SCAN_RATE cycles.

**  \par Description:
**       This parameter defines the function-to-call when a CPU or floating point exception
**       occurs.  The parameter is defaulted to call the ES API function #CFE_ES_ProcessCoreException
**       which handles the logging and reset from a system or cFE core exception.
**
**       Note: Exception interrupts are trapped at the Platform Support Package (PSP)
**       layer.  In order to initiate the cFE platform defined response to an exception, this
**       platform defined callback function must be prototyped and called from the PSP
**       exception hook API function #CFE_PSP_ExceptionHook. For example:
**
**       -- cfe_psp.h --
**
**       .... Prototype for exception ISR function implemented in CFE ....
**
**       typedef void (*System_ExceptionFunc_t)(uint32  HostTaskId,

**                                              uint32 ContextSize);
**
**       -- cfe_pspexception.c --
**
**       .... Setup function pointer to CFE exception ISR callback ....
**
**       static const System_ExceptionFunc_t CFE_ExceptionCallback = CFE_PLATFORM_ES_EXCEPTION_FUNCTION;
**
**       void CFE_PSP_ExceptionHook (int task_id, int vector, uint8 *pEsf )
**       {
**           .... platform-specific logic ....
**
**           .... Use function pointer to call cFE routine to finish processing the exception ....

/** \cfeescfg Poll timer for startup sync delay
**
**  \par Description:
**      During startup, some tasks may need to synchronize their own initialization
**      with the initialization of other applications in the system.
**
**      CFE ES implements an API to accomplish this, that performs a task delay (sleep)
**      while polling the overall system state until other tasks are ready.
**
**      This value controls the amount of time that the CFE_ES_ApplicationSyncDelay
**      will sleep between each check of the system state.  This should be large enough
**      to allow other tasks to run, but not so large as to noticeably delay the startup
**      completion.

**      Units are in milliseconds

**       Must be defined as an integer value that is greater than

**      "ready" states.
**
**      The CFE "main" thread starts individual tasks for each of the core applications
**      (except FS).  Each of these must perform some initialization work before the
**      next core application can be started, so the main thread waits to ensure that the
**      application has reached the "ready" state before starting the next application.
**
**      If any core application fails to start, then it indicates a major problem with
**      the system and startup is aborted.

**
**      Unlike the "core" app timeout, this is a soft limit; if the alloted time is exceeded,

 *
 * The following section provides a mapping from the historical name to
 * the new name for compatibility with existing code.  The code can then be
