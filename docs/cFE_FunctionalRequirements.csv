SB: Send Message,cSB4305,"Upon receipt of a Request to send an SB Message, the cFE shall route the SB Message to the Pipes of all Applications that have Subscribed to the SB Message.","This form of message passing, supports one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-one (all desired by branch members) in a flexible, low overhead manner.  It has been common for telemetry packets to be sent to many destinations, such as a real-time telemetry."
SB: Send Message - Message ID To Pipe Limit,cSB4305.1,The cFE shall limit the number of messages of a particular Message ID that can be sent to an Application's Pipe.,"Prevent an errant application from monopolizing a Software Bus Pipe. This feature was part of the heritage software bus and was found to be a useful diagnostic feature.  When subscribing to a packet, an Application can specify a limit on the number of Messages for a particular Message ID that can be in the Pipe at one time. The term used for this is MsgId-to-Pipe Limit.
"
SB: Send Message - Pipe Overflow,cSB4305.3,"If routing a Message to an Application's Pipe results in a Pipe Overflow, the cFE shall abort the send to that pipe, issue an event, and continue sending to the remaining pipes.",The ground needs to know if a message cannot be routed to its destination.

The number of messages a Pipe is capable of storing is defined by a platform configuration parameter.
SB: Send Message - Exceed Message ID To Pipe Limit,cSB4305.4,"If routing a Message to an Application's Pipe would exceed the MsgId-to-Pipe Limit, the cFE shall abort the send to that pipe, issue an event, and continue sending to the remaining pipes.",The ground needs to know if a message cannot be routed to its destination. The MsgId-to-Pipe Limit is exceeded when the SB attempts to write to a Pipe that contains the maximum number of messages of a particular Message Id.
SB: Send Message - No Subscribers,cSB4305.5,"Upon receipt of a Request to send a Message, if no Application's have Subscribed to the Message, the cFE shall increment the No Subscriber's Counter and send an event that displays the Message ID.","A single counter is enough to notify operators that there are no receivers for a packet that is being sent. The ‘no subscriber’s’ event is completely filtered by default. The ground can unfilter the ‘no subscribers’ event to get more information about the message. It is not considered an error if no Applications have subscribed because of the dynamic environment supported by the cFE. In addition, during initialization of a multi-processor system, this can easily occur.

A receive Request without a suspension timeout provides a non-blocking method of retrieving SB messages. Receives are performed on a Pipe basis not on a SB Message basis. The heritage SB Pipe-based receives have served us well. A message-based receive would add extra complexity without any real benefit.
SB: Receive Message With Timeout,cSB4307,"Upon receipt of a Request to receive a SB Message from a Pipe with a pending timeout, the cFE shall suspend execution of the Application until a SB Message is present on the Pipe or the timeout has expired.","A receive Request with a suspension timeout provides a blocking method of retrieving SB messages. This is useful for data driven Applications and has been used on all heritage missions with a SB. The timeout is useful for fault recovery for Applications that always expect data to arrive or to allow periodic processing for Applications that are not purely data driven. If a SB Message is queued on the Pipe then the SB Message will be provided to the Application and the Application’s execution will not be suspended. Tasks that process telemetry packets often receive many types of packets from different sources.  There should be a mechanism that allows a task to wait for many different types of messages simultaneously.  Heritage implementations of SB do this by directing the messages into one queue (or several queues, to implement priority levels).

TBL: Create,cTBL6300,"Upon receipt of Request, the cFE shall create a zero filled Table Image with the Request specified name, size, buffering characteristics (single or double-buffer), dump-only characteristics, criticality and Table Validation Function address.","Supports the cFE's dynamic Application model. Tables will be able to be either single or double-buffered.  Double buffering will allow instantaneous updates from the Application's point of view and will be useful for interrupt service routines, etc.  However, double buffering will consume more memory resources.  The Table Validation Function is optionally provided by the Application and is called when a Command to Validate the table is made. Note that a zero filled image will not be created if the Application specifies an address for the dump-only table (see cTBL6300.1)."
TBL: Create - App Supplied Address For Dump Only,cTBL6300.1,The cFE shall allow an Application to specify an address as the one and only buffer for a dump-only Table.,"Heritage code allowed for dump only tables to come from an address instead of a true table.
