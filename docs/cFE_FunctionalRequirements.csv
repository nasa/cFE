This is especially true in a distributed system with common subsystems. It is the intent of this requirement to allow identical subsystems to be resident in multiple processors within the flight system.  In cases like this, the subsystem identifier, and message identifier may be the same; only the processor identifier would make the messages unique.  A long format is desirable because it contains the most information.  Design Note: It is expected that in the implemented event service, the API only requires the Event ID and Type, and that the underlying utility code fills in the processor ID, and Application ID before the message is sent."
EVS: Create Message - Long Format - Truncation,cEVS3103.4.1,"If the Event Data is greater than the `<MISSION_DEFINED>` maximum Event Data, the cFE shall truncate the Event Message with a string-termination character and increment the Message Truncation Counter.","It's important to know if data is lost, but it doesn't need to be maintained on a per-Event ID basis, therefore a single counter is used.

If an error occurs when there's no communication then the Local Event Log size must be large enough to retain the Event Messages since communications was lost. Discarding the newest Event Message is useful for trouble shooting a problem. For example there may be a problem during processor initialization that occurs when there's no communications with the processor interfacing with the User. In this case the original Event Messages are critical to solving the problem so they should be preserved. Note that the Event Logging Mode can be changed via stored commanding.

SB: Initialize Routing On Processor Reset,cSB4501,Upon a Processor Reset the cFE shall initialize the Routing Information and clear all error counters,The cFE must initialize to a known state.
SB: Last Message Sender Info,cSB4309,"Upon receipt of a Request, the cFE shall provide sender information for the last message received on an Application's Pipe.","Heritage SB did a 'valid senders check' before delivering a packet to a pipe. Since the cFE supports a dynamic environment and the sender of a packet is somewhat unknown, the cFE must provide a means for the application to do the 'valid sender check'."
SB: Maximum Destinations,cSB4704,"The cFE shall support a maximum of `<PLATFORM_DEFINED, 64>` Destinations for a Message ID.",Allow a mission to scale the number of destinations per message ID to reduce memory requirements. A maximum is specified to yield an efficient design. The default of 16 is used in the heritage SB.

TBD - Doesn't match pattern.  NOOP - version event, commands increment counter, invalid increment invalid counter.",Useful for verifying communication between the ground and SB task.
SB: Receive Message Infinite Timeout,cSB4308,"Upon receipt of a Request to receive a SB Message from a Pipe with an infinite timeout, the cFE shall suspend execution of the Application until a SB Message is present on the Pipe.",This mode of receiving has been the most commonly used mode on the heritage SB.
SB: Receive Message No Timeout,cSB4306,"Upon receipt of a Request to receive a SB Message from a Pipe without a timeout, the cFE shall remove the next SB Message from the Pipe and provide the message to the Application.",Applications need a mechanism to retrieve the SB Message they have subscribed to receive. A receive Request without a suspension timeout provides a non-blocking method of retrieving SB messages. Receives are performed on a Pipe basis not on a SB Message basis. The heritage SB Pipe-based receives have served us well. A message-based receive would add extra complexity without any real benefit.
SB: Receive Message With Timeout,cSB4307,"Upon receipt of a Request to receive a SB Message from a Pipe with a pending timeout, the cFE shall suspend execution of the Application until a SB Message is present on the Pipe or the timeout has expired.","A receive Request with a suspension timeout provides a blocking method of retrieving SB messages. This is useful for data driven Applications and has been used on all heritage missions with a SB. The timeout is useful for fault recovery for Applications that always expect data to arrive or to allow periodic processing for Applications that are not purely data driven. If a SB Message is queued on the Pipe then the SB Message will be provided to the Application and the Application’s execution will not be suspended. Tasks that process telemetry packets often receive many types of packets from different sources.  There should be a mechanism that allows a task to wait for many different types of messages simultaneously.  Heritage implementations of SB do this by directing the messages into one queue (or several queues, to implement priority levels).
"
SB: Save Message Map To File,cSB4008,"Upon receipt of a Command, the cFE shall save the message map information to the Command specified a file.","This information provides information pertaining to the internals of the SB (Msg ID, and SB Routing table index) which can be used for diagnostic purposes."

SB: Send Message,cSB4305,"Upon receipt of a Request to send an SB Message, the cFE shall route the SB Message to the Pipes of all Applications that have Subscribed to the SB Message.","This form of message passing, supports one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-one (all desired by branch members) in a flexible, low overhead manner.  It has been common for telemetry packets to be sent to many destinations, such as a real-time telemetry."
SB: Send Message - Exceed Message ID To Pipe Limit,cSB4305.4,"If routing a Message to an Application's Pipe would exceed the MsgId-to-Pipe Limit, the cFE shall abort the send to that pipe, issue an event, and continue sending to the remaining pipes.",The ground needs to know if a message cannot be routed to its destination. The MsgId-to-Pipe Limit is exceeded when the SB attempts to write to a Pipe that contains the maximum number of messages of a particular Message Id.
SB: Send Message - Max Size,cSB4305.6,"If the SB Message is greater than the `<MISSION_DEFINED,32767>` bytes then the cFE shall not send the message, issue and event message and increment the message send error counter.",The cFE should not make any assumptions about why the message was too big and just not send it.
SB: Send Message - Message ID To Pipe Limit,cSB4305.1,The cFE shall limit the number of messages of a particular Message ID that can be sent to an Application's Pipe.,"Prevent an errant application from monopolizing a Software Bus Pipe. This feature was part of the heritage software bus and was found to be a useful diagnostic feature.  When subscribing to a packet, an Application can specify a limit on the number of Messages for a particular Message ID that can be in the Pipe at one time. The term used for this is MsgId-to-Pipe Limit.
"
SB: Send Message - No Subscribers,cSB4305.5,"Upon receipt of a Request to send a Message, if no Application's have Subscribed to the Message, the cFE shall increment the No Subscriber's Counter and send an event that displays the Message ID.","A single counter is enough to notify operators that there are no receivers for a packet that is being sent. The ‘no subscriber’s’ event is completely filtered by default. The ground can unfilter the ‘no subscribers’ event to get more information about the message. It is not considered an error if no Applications have subscribed because of the dynamic environment supported by the cFE. In addition, during initialization of a multi-processor system, this can easily occur.
"
SB: Send Message - Pipe Overflow,cSB4305.3,"If routing a Message to an Application's Pipe results in a Pipe Overflow, the cFE shall abort the send to that pipe, issue an event, and continue sending to the remaining pipes.",The ground needs to know if a message cannot be routed to its destination. A Pipe Overflow occurs when the SB attempts to write to a Pipe that is completely full of SB messages. The number of messages a Pipe is capable of storing is defined by a platform configuration parameter.
SB: Statistics Message,cSB4002,"Upon receipt of a Command, the cFE shall send an SB Message containing the SB statistics.","Visibility of the SB statistics is essential for FSW diagnostics, testing, and maintenance."
SB: Subscribe To Message,cSB4303,"Upon receipt of a Request to Subscribe to an SB message, the cFE shall establish a route using the Request-specified Message ID, the Request-specified Pipe ID, the Request-specified MsgId-to-Pipe limit and the Request-specified QoS.",Run time subscription supports the cFE goals of easy system integration and run time reconfigurations.
SB: Subscribe To Message - Duplicate,cSB4303.1,If the Subscription is a duplicate of a previous subscription then the cFE shall issue an event message.,"Duplicate subscriptions are still a success, however, want to notify the ground."
SB: Unsubscribe To Message,cSB4304,"Upon receipt of a Request to Unsubscribe to an SB Message, the cFE shall remove the route corresponding to the Request-specified Message Id and the Request-specified Pipe Id from the Routing Information.","Allow an Application to dynamically change what Messages it receives. Since the ground can manipulate the state of the routing, it is not considered an error if the Message is not currently being subscribed to when an unsubscribe request is made."
SB: Zero Copy Message Transfer Mode,cSB4300,The cFE shall provide a zero-copy message transfer mode for intra-processor communication.,"The heritage software bus offered a zero-copy mode, it was used for transferring large packets from one application to another on the same processor.

TBL: Activate - Validate - Failure,cTBL6003.1.1,If the Inactive Table Image fails validation then the Inactive Table Image shall not be loaded into the Active Table Image.,Prevent loading of an invalid table. Note that the Inactive Table still contains the table image so that the ground can dump it.
TBL: Activate - Validate - No Validation Function,cTBL6003.1.2,"If a Table Validation Function does not exist for the specified Table, the Table shall be considered valid.",If there is no validation function then assume the table has good data in it (no way to check otherwise).
TBL: Create,cTBL6300,"Upon receipt of Request, the cFE shall create a zero filled Table Image with the Request specified name, size, buffering characteristics (single or double-buffer), dump-only characteristics, criticality and Table Validation Function address.","Supports the cFE's dynamic Application model. Tables will be able to be either single or double-buffered.  Double-buffering will allow instantaneous updates from the Application's point of view and will be useful for interrupt service routines, etc.  However, double-buffering will consume more memory resources.  The Table Validation Function is optionally provided by the Application and is called when a Command to Validate the table is made. Note that a zero filled image will not be created if the Application specifies an address for the dump-only table (see cTBL6300.1)."
TBL: Create - App Supplied Address For Dump Only,cTBL6300.1,The cFE shall allow an Application to specify an address as the one and only buffer for a dump-only Table.,"Heritage code allowed for dump only tables to come from an address instead of a true table.  In this case, table services does not allocate any memory for the dump only table.  This is referred to an an Application-Defined-Address-Table."
TBL: Dump To File,cTBL6001,Upon receipt of Command the cFE shall dump the Command specified Active or Inactive Table contents to a Command specified File.,Dumping the contents of a table to a file simplifies the telemetering of Table contents.

TIME: Diagnostic Message,cTIME2011,Upon receipt of Command the cFE shall generate a Software Bus message that includes time diagnostic information.,"When testing or debugging the time application, more details about time services are required."
TIME: Flywheel State,cTIME2012,Upon receipt of Command the cFE Time Services shall enter the Flywheel state.,Useful for testing.  This provides an easy way to cause the server or client to enter flywheeling mode so that local time calculations can be verified.  Also useful for testing the server/client time relations. 
TIME: Flywheel State - Ignore Updates,cTIME2012.1,The cFE shall ignore Time Updates while in Flywheel state.,"Again, this is used mainly for testing purposes.  Want to ignore time updates and update time using the local hardware clock."
TIME: Housekeeping Message,cTIME2000,"Upon receipt of Command the cFE shall generate a Software Bus message that includes the following items: 

- Time Status
- MET
- STCF
- Leap Seconds
- STCF continuous adjustment value.",It is common for sub-systems to report housekeeping status upon receipt of a housekeeping request command.
TIME: Invalid Command Counter,cTIME2004,"Upon receipt of an invalid command, the cFE shall in increment the invalid command counter.",The ground needs an indicator if a command is rejected by the cFE. Details of what makes a command invalid are documented in the cFE User's Guide.
TIME: MET Resolution,cTIME2703,The cFE shall define a MET with a `<MISSION_DEFINED>` resolution.,"The resolution (clock ticks per second) is hardware dependent. Since no other cFE component places any constraints on the resolution this requirement is not bounded with a minimum.  However, both the maximum number of MET seconds and the resolution of sub-seconds are both restricted to a value that can be stored as an unsigned 32 bit integer."
TIME: NOOP Event,cTIME2001,Upon receipt of Command the cFE shall generate a NO-OP event message. (Time Server and Time Client),This command is useful as a general sub-system aliveness test.
TIME: Power On Reset Default Values,cTIME2500,"Upon a Power-on Reset the cFE shall set the following time elements to their `<MISSION_DEFINED>` default values: 

- Time Status Data
- STCF
- Leap Seconds","At power on, the presumption is that the MET h/w register has been reset.  It is common to set the STCF and Leap Seconds at startup such that time is computed to a known and recognizable value."
TIME: Processor Reset CDS Values,cTIME2501,"Upon a Processor Reset the cFE shall acquire the following time elements from the `<MISSION_DEFINED>` Critical Data Store: 

- Time Status Data
- STCF
- Leap Seconds","Time is a critical system resource and every effort should be made to preserve it.  Following a processor reset, the presumption is that the MET h/w register is unaffected and that previously 'good' values for STCF and Leap Seconds can still be used to correct."
TIME: Processor Reset Verify CDS,cTIME2502,Upon a Processor Reset the cFE shall verify the Critical Data Store used to store time values.,"Verification of potentially damaged stored data is a standard practice.  Note that because time can be any value, verification potentially involves using a pattern."
TIME: Processor Reset Verify CDS - Initialize On Failure,cTIME2502.1,"If the critical data store is not valid, all of the time elements shall be initialized in the same fashion as following a power-on reset.",If the CDS can't be trusted then need to initialize to default values.
TIME: Provide Clock State,cTIME2308,"Upon receipt of a Request for the current Clock State, the cFE shall provide the Clock State to the requester using the format specified in the cFE Application Developer's Guide.","Need to make the Clock State available to applications.  Due to lack of a demonstrable use case, the requirement to provide clock state data as part of 'get time' functions has been deleted."
TIME: Provide Default,cTIME2302,"Upon receipt of a Request for the current time computed in the default format, the cFE shall provide the current time computed in the default selection of UTC or TAI to the requester using the format specified in the cFE Application Developer's Guide.",One of the mission defined selections is the choice of whether TAI or UTC will be the default time format.  And most callers do not care which time format is the current default.  This function avoids having to modify each individual caller when the default is requested.
TIME: Provide Leap Seconds,cTIME2307,"Upon receipt of a Request for the current Leap Seconds, the cFE shall provide the Leap Seconds to the requester using the format specified in the cFE Application Developer's Guide.",Need to make the Leap Seconds available to applications.
TIME: Provide MET,cTIME2303,"Upon receipt of a Request for the current MET, the cFE shall provide the MET to the requester using the format specified in the cFE Application Developer's Guide.",Need to make the MET available to applications.
TIME: Provide MET Seconds,cTIME2304,"Upon receipt of a Request for the current MET seconds, the cFE shall provide the MET seconds to the requester using the format specified in the cFE Application Developer's Guide.",Need to make the MET seconds available to applications.  This capability simplifies application logic.
TIME: Provide MET Sub-Seconds,cTIME2305,"Upon receipt of a Request for the current MET sub-seconds, the cFE shall provide the MET sub-seconds to the requester using the format specified in the cFE Application Developer's Guide.",Need to make the MET sub-seconds available to applications.  This capability simplifies application logic.
TIME: Provide Readable Format,cTIME2314,Upon receipt of a Request the cFE shall return the provided system time in the following format: `yyyy-ddd-hh:mm:ss.xxxxx\0`,Provides time in a readable string format.
TIME: Provide STCF,cTIME2306,"Upon receipt of a Request for the current STCF, the cFE shall provide the STCF to the requester using the format specified in the cFE Application Developer's Guide.",Need to make the STCF available to applications.
TIME: Provide TAI,cTIME2300,"Upon receipt of a Request for the current time computed as TAI, the cFE shall provide the TAI to the requester using the format specified in the cFE Application Developer's Guide.",Need to make the TAI available to applications.
TIME: Provide UTC,cTIME2301,"Upon receipt of a Request for the current time computed as UTC, the cFE shall provide the UTC to the requester using the format specified in the cFE Application Developer's Guide.",Need to make the UTC available to applications.
TIME: Set Leap Seconds,cTIME2005,Upon receipt of Command the cFE shall set the number of Leap Seconds to the Command-specified value.,The decision to introduce a leap second in UTC is the responsibility of the International Earth Rotation Service (IERS).  The count of Leap Seconds has been incremented about every 500 days since 1972.  It is therefore likely that a mission will need to update.
TIME: Set STCF,cTIME2006,Upon receipt of Command the cFE shall set the STCF to the Command specified value.,"The cFE must be provided with the appropriate correlation factor, that when combined with the current MET and Leap Seconds values, will result in current time. Historically this command has been referred to as 'jam loading' time."
TIME: Subtract From Spacecraft Time,cTIME2014,Upon receipt of Command the cFE shall adjust the spacecraft time by subtracting the Command specified value (seconds and subseconds) from spacecraft time.,"The client’s local clock might be running a little ahead the tone, therefore, an adjustment needs to be made to the time client’s time calculation."
TIME: Subtract Values,cTIME2310,"Upon receipt of a Request to subtract two time values, the cFE shall provide the result to the requester using the format specified in the cFE Application Developer's Guide.",Need to provide a common time subtraction function available to applications.
TIME: Switch Source,cTIME2010,`<MISSION_DEFINED>` Upon receipt of Command the cFE shall switch to the Command-specified hardware clock source.,This command is extremely hardware configuration dependent. The number and nature of alternate clocks will vary by system.  Many system designs provide primary and redundant clock sources (tone signals) and require autonomous clock switching based on failure.
TIME: Time At Tone Window,cTIME2701,The cFE Time Services Server shall send a time at the tone Software Bus message within a `<MISSION_DEFINED>` period of time preceding or following the tone.,"The primary purpose of a time server is to distribute time updates to time clients. Although the time tone is generally a 1PPS signal, there is no cFE restriction on the frequency of the tone.  Also, there is no cFE restriction on whether the ""time at the tone"" message precedes or follows the tone."
TIME: Update MET,cTIME2702,The cFE Time Services Server shall update its MET using the timer hardware interface defined in the cFE Application Developer's Guide.,Every mission needs an MET and using a cFE-defined software interface to the timer hardware driver makes the Time Services  portable.
TIME: Valid Command Counter,cTIME2003,"Upon receipt of valid command, the cFE shall increment the valid command counter.",The ground needs the capability to verify that the command was received and accepted by the cFE.  Details of  valid commands are documented in the cFE User's Guide.
TIME: Zero Counters,cTIME2002,Upon receipt of Command the cFE shall set to zero all counters reported in Time Services telemetry. (Time Server and Time Client),This command is a common feature in heritage sub-system software design.
