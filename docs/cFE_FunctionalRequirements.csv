A receive Request without a suspension timeout provides a non-blocking method of retrieving SB messages. Receives are performed on a Pipe basis not on a SB Message basis. The heritage SB Pipe-based receives have served us well. A message-based receive would add extra complexity without any real benefit.
SB: Receive Message With Timeout,cSB4307,"Upon receipt of a Request to receive a SB Message from a Pipe with a pending timeout, the cFE shall suspend execution of the Application until a SB Message is present on the Pipe or the timeout has expired.","A receive Request with a suspension timeout provides a blocking method of retrieving SB messages. This is useful for data driven Applications and has been used on all heritage missions with a SB. The timeout is useful for fault recovery for Applications that always expect data to arrive or to allow periodic processing for Applications that are not purely data driven. If a SB Message is queued on the Pipe then the SB Message will be provided to the Application and the Application’s execution will not be suspended. Tasks that process telemetry packets often receive many types of packets from different sources.  There should be a mechanism that allows a task to wait for many different types of messages simultaneously.  Heritage implementations of SB do this by directing the messages into one queue (or several queues, to implement priority levels).

Tables will be able to be either single or double-buffered.  Double buffering will allow instantaneous updates from the Application's point of view and will be useful for interrupt service routines, etc.  However, double buffering will consume more memory resources.  The Table Validation Function is optionally provided by the Application and is called when a Command to Validate the table is made. Note that a zero filled image will not be created if the Application specifies an address for the dump-only table (see cTBL6300.1)."
