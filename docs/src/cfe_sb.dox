/**
  \page cfesbovr cFE Software Bus Overview

  The Software Bus (SB) handles communication between software tasks on a processor.
  All tasks communicate with each other, with hardware devices, and with the ground
  by sending command and telemetry messages.  The software bus provides an application
  programming interface (API) to other tasks for sending and receiving messages.
  This API is independent of the underlying operating system so that tasks can use
  the same interface regardless of which processor they reside on.  Refer to the \ref cfeapi for detailed information about the API functions.

  The software bus is used internally by the flight software, and normally does not
  require attention from the ground.  However, because of the scalability and the
  dynamic nature of the software bus, it is strongly recommended that each project
  carefully review the SB statistics and SB memory pool to be sure adequate margin is
  met on the configurable items.

  The cFE software bus uses a dynamic protocol and builds its routing table at run-time through
  the SB subscribe API's. Also the cFE software bus pipes are created at run-time through
  the #CFE_SB_CreatePipe API. Because the routing is established, and pipes are created
  at run-time, it is necessary to have a clear view of the routing details on command.
  The cFE software bus allows the user to dump the routing table, the pipe table, the
  message map and the statistics packet. Each of these items are described in detail
  in the corresponding section of this document.

/**
  \page cfesbugmsgs Messages

  The sole purpose of the software bus is to provide applications a way to send
  messages to each other. The term message and the term packet are used
  interchangeably throughout this document. A message is a combined set of bytes
  with a predefined format that is used as the basis of communication on a spacecraft.
  All commands, telemetry, and other data that are passed between the ground and
  the spacecraft, and between subsystems of the spacecraft, are considered to be
  messages. The most common message format is CCSDS (Consultative Committee for
  Space Data Systems) in <a href="https://public.ccsds.org/Pubs/133x0b2.pdf">
  CCSDS Space Packet Protocol</a>, but can be customized by replacing the message module.

  There are two general types of messages - commands (or command packets) and
  telemetry (or telemetry packets).  Command packets are sent to a particular
  software task from the ground (or another task).  Telemetry packets are sent
  from a particular software task to the ground (or other tasks).

  The concept of a message identifier is utilized to provide abstraction
  from header implementation, often abbreviated as message ID, MsgId, or MID.
  Header and message identifier values should not be accessed directly to
  avoid implementation specific dependencies.

  Telemetry packets typically contain a timestamp that indicates when the packet
  was produced.  Command packets typically contain a command code that identifies
  the particular type of command.

  The message module provides APIs for 'setting' and 'getting' the fields in the
  header of the message.  The message module was separated from software bus
  to enable users to customize message headers without requiring clone and
  own of the entire cfe repository.  To customize, remove the built in msg
  module from the build and replace with custom implementation.  See sample
  target definitions folder for examples.

  Following the header is the user defined message data.

/**
  \page cfesbugpipes Pipes

  The destinations to which messages are sent are called pipes.  These are queues
  that can hold messages  until they are read out and processed by a task.  Each
  pipe is created at run-time through the #CFE_SB_CreatePipe API.  The pipe name
  and the pipe depth are given as arguments in the API. The pipe identifier (or
  PipeId) is given back to the caller after the API is executed. Each pipe can be
  read by only one task, but a task may read more than one pipe. Only the pipe
  owner is allowed to subscribe to messages on the pipe.

  The Pipe IDs are specific to a particular processor (that is, the same ID number
  may refer to a different pipe on each processor).  The pipe information for all
  pipes that have been created, may be requested at anytime by sending the
  \link #CFE_SB_WRITE_PIPE_INFO_CC 'Write Pipe Info' SB command \endlink. The software
  bus also provides a set of figures regarding capacity, current utilization and high
  water marks relevant to pipes. This information may be requested by sending the
  command to \link #CFE_SB_SEND_SB_STATS_CC dump the SB statistics packet \endlink.

/**
  \page cfesbugsubs Subscriptions

  A subscription is a run-time request for a particular message to be sent to a
  particular pipe. If the caller of the subscribe API is not the owner of the
  pipe, the request is rejected and an error event is sent. The application
  that creates the pipe is considered the owner of the pipe. The pipe specified
  in the subscription is sometimes referred to as the destination of the message.
  There are a maximum number of destinations for a particular message. This
  value is specified by the platform configuration parameter
  #CFE_PLATFORM_SB_MAX_DEST_PER_PKT.

  As subscriptions are received, the destinations are added to the head of a
  linked list. During the sending of a message, the list is traversed beginning
  at the head of the list. Therefore the message will first be sent to the last
  subscriber. If an application has timing constraints and needs to receive a
  message in the shortest possible time, the developer may consider holding off
  its subscription until other applications have subscribed to the message.

  The message limit specifies the maximum number of messages (with the specified
  Message ID) that are allowed on the specified pipe at any time. This limit is
  specified by the application at the time of the subscription. If the application
  uses the #CFE_SB_Subscribe API, a message limit default value of four is used.
  If this default value is not sufficient, the caller would use the
  #CFE_SB_SubscribeEx API that allows the message limit to be specified.

  The software bus also provides the user with an option to unsubscribe to a
  message. The \link #CFE_SB_Unsubscribe unsubscribe API \endlink takes two
  parameters, Message ID and Pipe ID. Only the owner of a pipe may unsubscribe
  to messages on that pipe.

/**
  \page cfesbugmem Memory

  The software bus statically allocates a block of memory for message buffers and
  subscription blocks. The size of this memory block is defined by the platform configuration
  parameter #CFE_PLATFORM_SB_BUF_MEMORY_BYTES. The memory is managed by the cFE ES memory
  pool and is used only by the software bus. The ES memory pool allows an application to define
  the block sizes for the pool at compile time. These sizes are defined by the platform
  configuration parameters prefixed with CFE_SB_MEM_BLOCK_SIZE (for example, #CFE_PLATFORM_SB_MEM_BLOCK_SIZE_01).
  It is recommended that a project tailor these values for the mission, based on the software
  bus packet sizes.

  At the time a message is sent, two buffers are allocated from the pool. One for a
  buffer descriptor (CFE_SB_BufferD_t) and one for the size of the packet. Both buffers
  are returned to the pool when the message has been received by all recipients. More
  precisely, if there is one recipient for a message, the message buffers will be released
  on the following call to CFE_SB_ReceiveBuffer for the pipe that received the buffer.

  Also when subscriptions are received through the subscribe API's, the software bus
  allocates a subscription block (CFE_SB_DestinationD_t) from the pool. The subscription
  blocks are returned to the pool if and when the subscription is nullified through a
  #CFE_SB_Unsubscribe call.

  The software bus provides a set of figures regarding memory capacity, current memory
  utilization and high water marks relevant to the SB memory pool. This information may be
  requested by sending the command to dump the SB statistics packet. In addition, the
  current memory utilization value and the 'unmarked memory' value (#CFE_PLATFORM_SB_BUF_MEMORY_BYTES
  minus peak memory in use)  are sent in software bus housekeeping telemetry. The unmarked
  memory value  should be monitored regularly to ensure that the value (in bytes) does not
  continue to decline or approach zero. If this value were to approach zero, there is a
  possibility that memory requests would fail which may inhibit the sending of a message.
  The current memory utilization value should also be monitored to ensure the system
  contains no memory leaks. The value (in bytes) should remain stable under nominal
  conditions.
  Refer to the ES users guide for more information regarding the ES Memory Pool.

/**
  \page cfesbugauto Autonomous Actions

  The software bus is primarily a set of library routines that are called by other software
  tasks to send and receive packets.  The software bus does not perform any operations
  autonomously, except for sending event messages if errors are detected during the transfer
  of packets.

  As do other tasks, the SB task sends out housekeeping telemetry when requested through the
  'Send Housekeeping Data' command.

/**
  \page cfesbugrouting Message Routing

  In the software bus, all messages are processed in a similar way. The software bus uses the
  Message ID and the packet length fields (contained in the header) for routing the message
  to the destination pipe. If either of these two fields do not pass validation, the software
  bus generates an error event and aborts the delivery process. The software bus performs some
  validation checks by simply checking message header values against mission or platform
  configuration parameters. Messages originating from various tasks or instruments are routed
  to one or more pipes, where they wait until read by a task.  The routing configuration for
  each message is established when applications call one of the SB subscribe APIs. The subscribe
  APIs take a Message ID and a Pipe ID as parameters. The routing for each packet is stored in
  SB memory and may be requested at any time by sending the 'Send Routing Info' command. The
  software bus also provides a set of figures regarding capacity, current utilization and high
  water marks relevant to the routing. This information may be requested by sending the command
  to dump the SB statistics packet.

/**
  \page cfesbugpktseqvals Packet Sequence Values

  The sequence count behavior depends on if the message is a command type or telemetry type.

  The sequence counter for command messages is not altered by the software bus.

  For a telemetry message, the behavior is controlled via API input parameters when sending.
  When enabled, the software bus will populate the packet sequence
  counter using an internal counter that gets initialized upon the first subscription to the
  message (first message will have a packet sequence counter value of 1).  From that point on
  each send request will increment the counter by one, regardless of the number of destinations
  or if there is an active subscription.

  After a rollover condition the sequence counter will be a value of zero for one instance.
  The sequence counter is incremented after all the checks have passed prior to the actual
  sending of the message. This includes the parameter checks and the memory allocation check.

  When disabled, the original message will not be altered.  This method of message delivery
  is recommended for situations where the sender did not generate the packet,
  such as a network interface application passing a packet from a remote system to the local
  software bus.

/**
  \page cfesbugmsgpipeerr Message Limit Error

  Before placing a message on a pipe, the software bus checks the message limit to
  ensure the maximum number of packets in transit to the destination is not exceeded.
  If placing the message on the pipe would exceed the message limit, then the action
  of sending to that pipe is aborted and the 'Message Limit Error' event is
  sent. This condition will typically occur when an application that receives the
  packets does not respond quickly enough, or if the sender of the packets produces
  them too quickly.

  This condition occurs often during development and during integration, for example
  when a remote processor gets reset or a 1553 cable becomes disconnected.  Because
  of the common occurrences, the event may have filtering associated with it. Any
  filtering for this event would be performed by the cFE Event Services (EVS). Filtering
  for SB events may be specified in the cFE platform configuration file or may be
  commanded after the system initializes.

  If this error occurs during nominal conditions, it could be an indication that the
  'message limit' is not set correctly. The message limit is given at the time of the
  subscription and given as a parameter in the subscribe API. With the #CFE_SB_Subscribe
  API, the SB uses a default message limit value specified by #CFE_PLATFORM_SB_DEFAULT_MSG_LIMIT.
  This constant is currently set to a value of four. If the default value is insufficient,
  the message limit value can be specified in the #CFE_SB_SubscribeEx API.

  A related failure is the pipe overflow condition, which can occur if the total number
  of packets (of all kinds) sent to a particular pipe is too large.

/**
  \page cfesbugovererr Pipe Overflow Error

  Another common error that occurs during the send process is the pipe overflow error.
  This condition occurs if the total number of packets (of all kinds) sent to a particular
  pipe is too large.  If this error occurs too frequently, it may be an indication that
  the pipe depth is not set correctly. The pipe depth is given at the time the pipe is
  created as a parameter in the #CFE_SB_CreatePipe API.

/**
  \page cfesbugeventfilt SB Event Filtering

  Most filtering for SB events is performed by the cFE Event Services (EVS). Filtering for
  SB events may be specified in the cFE platform configuration file or may be commanded
  after the system initializes. There is no SB event log that limits the number of events
  based on the capacity of the log, as in the heritage software bus.

  There is one case in which events are filtered by the software bus instead of event services.
  This occurs when the software bus needs to suppress events so that a fatal recursive event
  condition does not transpire. Because error cases encountered when sending a message generate
  an event, and events cause a message to be sent
  a calling sequence could cause a stack overflow if the recursion is not properly terminated.
  The cFE software bus detects this condition and properly terminates the recursion. This is
  done by using a set of flags (one flag per event in the Send API) which determine whether
  an API has relinquished its stack. If the software bus needs to send an event that may
  cause recursion, the flag is set and the event is sent. If sending the event would cause
  the same event again, the event call will be bypassed, terminating the
  recursion. The result is that the user will see only one event instead of the many events
  that would normally occur without the protection. The heritage software bus did not have
  this condition because it stored events in the software bus event log and another thread
  would read them out at a later time.

/**
  \page cfesbugdiagdata Diagnostic Data

  The cFE software bus provides a set of commands to dump SB diagnostic data to help
  troubleshoot problems or check configuration settings. These commands allow the
  user to view the routing table, the pipe table or the message map. The message map
  is a lookup table used during a send operation to give fast access to the routing
  table index that corresponds to the message being sent.

  The software bus also provides a statistics packet that can be used to tune the
  configuration parameters. This information is sent to the ground in the form of
  an SB packet when the corresponding command is received. The cFE limits the number
  of system pipes, unique Message IDs, buffer memory, messages on a pipe and
  subscriptions per Message ID. These limits are configurable through cFE platform
  and mission configuration parameters. The statistics packet was designed to let
  the project verify that these user settings provide the necessary margin to meet
  requirements.

  The SB statistics information shows 'Currently In Use' figures, 'High Water Mark'
  figures and 'Max Allowed' figures for the following: buffer memory, messages on
  each pipe (pipe depth stats), System Pipes, Unique Message IDs and total subscriptions.

  Depending on the task-scheduling implementation details of the operating system, it is
  possible to see the peak messages on a pipe occasionally exceed the depth of the pipe.
  The "Peak Messages In Use" parameter is included in the SB statistics packet under the
  pipe depth stats.

/**
  \page cfesbugknwnprob Known Problem

  The software bus may perform unexpectedly under an unlikely corner-case scenario. This
  scenario was revealed in a stress test. The stress test was designed to deplete the Software
  Bus memory pool by having a high priority application continuously send 1000 byte packets
  to a lower priority application until the memory pool code returned an error code and sent
  the following event. "CFE_ES:getPoolBuf err:Request won't fit in remaining memory" At this
  point the higher priority sending application would stop executing. This would allow the
  lower priority receiving application to begin receiving the 1000 byte packets. After the
  receiving app processed all of the packets, the memory was restored to the memory pool as
  expected. The SB memory-in-use telemetry was zero because there were no software bus
  packets in transit. At this point any attempt to send a new-sized packet on the software
  bus was be rejected. The ES memory pool stated that the "…Request won't fit in remaining
  memory" even though there was currently no memory in use.

  The simplest way to prevent this behavior is to ensure that there is margin when sizing the
  SB memory pool. To check the margin, monitor the "Peak Memory in Use" vs. the configuration
  parameter #CFE_PLATFORM_SB_BUF_MEMORY_BYTES which indicates the amount allocated.

        </B><TR><TD WIDTH="5%"> &nbsp; <TD WIDTH="95%">
           To route the message properly, the software bus uses only the Message ID and
           packet length fields from the header of the message. If the packet length field
           is incorrect, then the buffer allocation for the message will also be incorrect.
           This may appear to the receiver as a truncated message or a message with unknown
           data added to the end of the message.
        <TR><TD COLSPAN=2 WIDTH="100%"> <B>(Q)
           How many copies of the message are performed in a typical message delivery?
        </B><TR><TD WIDTH="5%"> &nbsp; <TD WIDTH="95%">
           There is a single copy of the message performed when sending a message
           (from the callers memory space) using CFE_SB_TransmitMsg.
           When transmitting the message, the software bus copies the message from the
           callers memory space into a buffer in the software bus memory space. There
           is also the option to request a buffer from SB, write directly to the buffer
           and send via CFE_SB_TransmitBuffer.  This is equivalent to the previous zero
           copy implementation.
           The #CFE_SB_ReceiveBuffer API gives the user back a pointer to the buffer. When
           working with the buffers, the additional complexity to be aware of is the
           buffer is only available to the app from the request to send (on the sending side),
           or from the receive until the next receive on the same pipe on the receiving side.
           If the data is required outside that scope, the app needs a local copy.

           After receiving a buffer by calling #CFE_SB_ReceiveBuffer, the buffer received is valid
           until the next call to #CFE_SB_ReceiveBuffer with the same Pipe Id.
           If the caller needs the message longer than the next call to
           #CFE_SB_ReceiveBuffer, the caller must copy the message to its memory space.

        </B><TR><TD WIDTH="5%"> &nbsp; <TD WIDTH="95%">
           Typically a caller declares a ptr of type CFE_SB_Buffer_t (i.e. CFE_SB_Buffer_t *Ptr)
           then gives the address of that pointer (&Ptr) as this parameter. After a successful
           call to #CFE_SB_ReceiveBuffer, Ptr will point to the first byte of the software bus
           buffer. This should be used as a read-only pointer. In systems with an MMU, writes
           to this pointer may cause a memory protection fault.

           a flood of SB events such as No Subscribers, Pipe Overflow and MsgId to Pipe errors.
           This gives the user a way to limit these events.

           Why does SB have so many debug event messages?
        </B><TR><TD WIDTH="5%"> &nbsp; <TD WIDTH="95%">
           The SB debug messages are positive acknowledgments that an action (like receiving a
           cmd, creating a pipe or subscribing to a message) has occurred. They are intended to
           help isolate system problems. For instance, if an expected response to a command is
           not happening, it may be possible to repeat the scenario with the debug event turned
           on to verify that the command was successfully received.

           How is the QOS parameter in the #CFE_SB_SubscribeEx used by the software bus?
        </B><TR><TD WIDTH="5%"> &nbsp; <TD WIDTH="95%">
           The QOS parameter is currently unused by the software bus. It is a placeholder to be
           used with the future software bus capability of inter-processor communication. Setting
           the QOS as #CFE_SB_DEFAULT_QOS will ensure seamless integration when the software bus
           is expanded to support inter-processor communication.

           Can I confirm my software bus buffer was delivered?
        </B><TR><TD WIDTH="5%"> &nbsp; <TD WIDTH="95%">
           There is no built in mechanism for confirming delivery (it could span systems).
           This could be accomplished by generating a response message from the receiver.

**  \page cfesbcmds cFE Software Bus Commands
**
**  Upon receipt of any command, the Software Bus application will confirm that the
**  message length embedded within the header (from `CFE_MSG_GetSize()`) matches the expected
**  length of that message, based on the size of the C structure defining that command.
**  If there is any discrepancy between the expected and actual message size, SB will generate
**  the #CFE_SB_LEN_ERR_EID event, increment the command error counter (\SB_CMDEC), and the
**  command will _not_ be accepted for processing.
**
**  The following is a list of commands that are processed by the cFE Software Bus Task.
