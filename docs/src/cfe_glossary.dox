        <TH> Definition
     <TR>
        <TD> \anchor cfeadg_application Application (or App)
        <TD> A set of data and functions that is treated as a single entity
             by the cFE.  cFE resources are allocated on a per-Application
             basis.  Applications are made up of a Main Task and zero or
             more Child Tasks.
     <TR>
        <TD> \anchor cfeadg_applicationid Application ID
        <TD> A processor unique reference to an Application. <BR>
             <B> NOTE: This is different from a CCSDS Application ID which is
             referred to as an "APID." </B>
     <TR>
        <TD> \anchor cfeadg_api Application Programmer's Interface (API)
        <TD> A set of routines, protocols, and tools for building software
             applications
     <TR>
        <TD> \anchor cfeadg_psp Platform Support Package (PSP)
        <TD> A collection of user-provided facilities that interface an OS
             and the cFE with a specific hardware platform.  The PSP is
             responsible for hardware initialization.
     <TR>
        <TD> \anchor cfeadg_childtask Child Task
        <TD> A separate thread of execution that is spawned by an
             Application's Main Task.
     <TR>
        <TD> \anchor cfeadg_command Command
        <TD> A Software Bus Message defined by the receiving Application.
             Commands can originate from other onboard Applications or
             from the ground.
     <TR>
        <TD> \anchor cfeadg_cfe Core Flight Executive (cFE)
        <TD> A runtime environment and a set of services for hosting FSW
             Applications
     <TR>
        <TD> \anchor cfeadg_cds Critical Data Store (CDS)
        <TD> A collection of data that is not modified by the OS or
             cFE following a Processor Reset.
     <TR>
        <TD> \anchor cfeadg_crc Cyclic Redundancy Check
        <TD> A polynomial-based method for checking that a data set
             has remained unchanged from one time period to another.
     <TR>
        <TD> \anchor cfeadg_developer Developer
        <TD> Anyone who is coding a cFE Application.
     <TR>
        <TD> \anchor cfeadg_eventdata Event Data
        <TD> Data describing an Event that is supplied to the cFE
             Event Service. The cFE includes this data in an
             \ref cfeadg_eventmessage "Event Message".
     <TR>
        <TD> \anchor cfeadg_eventfilter Event Filter
        <TD> A numeric value (bit mask) used to determine how
             frequently to output an application Event Message
             defined by its \ref cfeadg_eventid "Event ID".
     <TR>
        <TD> \anchor cfeadg_eventformatmode Event Format Mode
        <TD> Defines the Event Message Format downlink option: short or long.
             The short format is used when there is limited telemetry bandwidth 
             and is binary.  The long format is in ASCII and is used for
             logging to a Local Event Log and to an Event Message Port.
     <TR>
        <TD> \anchor cfeadg_eventid Event ID
        <TD> A numeric literal used to uniquely name an Application event.
     <TR>
        <TD> \anchor cfeadg_eventtype Event Type
        <TD> A numeric literal used to identify the type of an Application event.
             An event type may be #CFE_EVS_EventType_DEBUG, #CFE_EVS_EventType_INFORMATION,
             #CFE_EVS_EventType_ERROR, or #CFE_EVS_EventType_CRITICAL.
     <TR>
        <TD> \anchor cfeadg_eventmessage Event Message
        <TD> A data item used to notify the user and/or an external
             \ref cfeadg_application "Application" of a significant event.
             Event Messages include a time-stamp of when the message was
             generated, a processor unique identifier, an
             \ref cfeadg_applicationid "Application ID", the
             \ref cfeadg_eventtype "Event Type" (DEBUG,INFO,ERROR or CRITICAL),
             and \ref cfeadg_eventdata "Event Data".  An Event Message can
             either be real-time or playback from a Local Event Log.
