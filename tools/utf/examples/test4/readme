This test exercises the validation callback function for cFE Table Services.
The TT task defines a validation function which considers a table valid if
each of the 4 numbers is a multiple of 5.  If any of the 4 numbers are
invalid, then the table is considered invalid.

This test compiles and links without warnings using the gcc compiler both within
Eclipse and in the command shell.

Unlike previous tests, the data files for the table data are written to and read
from the same directory that includes this file, the test driver, and the 
executable.

Note that to run within Eclipse, the command input file, ttscript4.in, needs to be 
in the project rather than the test directory.
